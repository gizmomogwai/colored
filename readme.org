** Intro
colored is yet another terminal coloring lib for dlang. compared to
others the source is really minimalistic, dependencies include only
unit_threaded for testing.

** Usage
#+NAME: example
#+BEGIN_SRC D
import colored;
unittest {
  import std.stdio;
  writeln("test".green.onRed);
}
#+END_SRC

** Api
The api allows only setting a foreground and backgroundcolor
once. This is done by returning dedicated types after each operation.
